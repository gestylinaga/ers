### Build Tips:
- [ ] "How to Theorycraft a Build"
  - What rune level am I going up to?
  - Am I planning on doing PVP (Duels/Invasions)?
  - What do I want as a main damage stat?
  - Will I choose a second damage stat?
  - Which weapons do I plan on using?

- [ ] Leveling a Build:
  - Leveling Priority:
    1. Strength/Dexterity to minimum required for weapon(s)
    2. Vigor to 40
    3. Endurance to match armor needs
    4. Vigor to 60
    5. Main damage stat up to soft-cap
  - NOTE: Damage comes from upgrading weapons at this level, not damage stat 
    investment, focus on leveling vigor early!
  - Around level ~125-150 now
  - Leveling Priority (post-125):
    1. clean up stats (hit soft-caps)
    2. hit soft-cap for secondary damage stat
  - RL >200
    - leveling anything, frankenstein freak build, max it all
